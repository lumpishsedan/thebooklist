The objective is to introduce the concept of forms with its complex parts.

earlier we were succussful in creating a form simply by using the
code {{ form.as_p }} inside the template file.

and we were able to route after form submission using get_absolute_url

that is all good but now we will get our hands dirty with modelforms.
